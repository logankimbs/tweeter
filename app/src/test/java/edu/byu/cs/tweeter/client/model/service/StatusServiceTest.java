    // Using JUnit and Mockito, write an INTEGRATION test for your client-side Service that
    // returns a user's story pages (i.e., StatusService). The Service should have an operation
    // that creates a background task to retrieve a user's story from the server and notifies the
    // Service's observer of the operation's outcome. Your test should verify that the Service's
    // observer is notified in the case of a successful story retrieval.
    // Note: you do NOT have to write tests for the other outcomes (i.e., failing not because of
    // an exception, failing because of an exception).
